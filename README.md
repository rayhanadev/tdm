# The Data Mine

My submissions for Purdue's [Data Mine](https://www.purdue.edu/datamine/) program. I have
cataloged my work by semester and project starting with TDM 10200 (Spring 2025).

Please feel free to reference my work if you get stuck on a problem, however, avoid copying
the solutions directly and cite me at the top of your project if you do.
